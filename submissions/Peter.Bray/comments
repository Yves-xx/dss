	I have included a diff against the streamingadminserver.pl, whichaddresses the following issues:		- "perl -wc" warnings removed (including coding error)		- LD_LIBRARY_PATH added to ENV to ensure the		  dynamically linked DarwinStreamingServer will start		  (gcc-3.0.2 on solaris dynamically links in libstdc++)		- configuration refactoring to remove duplication		- location independence - my hobby horse :-)Peter
