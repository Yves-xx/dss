\f1\b0\fs28 \cf0 The Streaming Admin requires 
\f2\fs24 ActivePerl 5.8 
\f1\fs28 (or later) to be running on the server machine. You must install a 
\f2\fs24 Perl 
\f1\fs28 interpreter in order to use the web-based administration software. \
\
\
To install Darwin Streaming Server software, follow these steps on the server computer:\
\
Stop any Darwin Streaming Server related processes.\
\
When the Server package is unzipped, a folder with Darwin Streaming Server and associated files will be created. Inside this folder is an Install script, named "Install.bat". Double-click this file to install the server and its components on the server machine. The installer also starts up the Streaming Server Admin, so keep the command prompt window open.\
\pard\ql\qnatural

\fs24 \cf0 \'ca\
\pard\ql\qnatural

\fs28 \cf0 The Install script will create the following directory:\
\
\pard\li540\ql\qnatural
\cf0 c:\\Program Files\\Darwin Streaming Server\\\
\pard\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
Inside this directory you will find:\
\

\cf0 The Install script will attempt to launch the Admin Server. Make sure that the Perl interpreter installed on your machine is in the system PATH.\
\
The Admin Server can be launched from the command prompt by typing:\
\
C:\\> 
\f3\i perlpath
\f1\i0  "C:\\Program Files\\Darwin Streaming Server\\streamingadminserver.pl"\
\
\pard\li360\fi-360\ql\qnatural
\cf0 where 
\f3\i perlpath
\f1\i0  is the path to the Perl interpreter on your machine.\
\
\
    If you are installing for the first time,  you will be asked to create a user name and password for administering the server.  You must complete this step to administer the server from a remote system using a web browser.\
