System Requirements

Darwin Streaming Server is currently available on the following platforms:

*Mac OS X (version 10.2.8 or later)
*Linux (RedHat 8/9, Intel)
*Solaris 9 (SPARC)
*Windows 2000 Server/2003 Server

Darwin Streaming Server is compatible with QuickTime 4 or later client software. Digest mode Authentication and Skip Protection (first introduced in QuickTime Streaming Server 3.0) require QuickTime 5 or later client software.

Installing Darwin Streaming Server (Mac OS X)

To install Darwin Streaming Server 5.5 software, follow these 
steps:

1. After downloading Darwin Streaming Server, double-click the DarwinStreamingServer.dmg file. DarwinStreamingServer will mount a desktop image that contains DarwinStreamingServer.pkg.  

2. Double-click the DarwinStreamingServer.pkg file. This will launch the installer.

3. Click on the "lock" icon to make changes when prompted during installation. You will need to authenticate with the administrator username and password.

4. Follow the onscreen instructions. After you have read and agreed to the license, you can proceed with the installation.

5. If you are installing for the first time, after the install completes, you will be asked to create a user name and password for administering the server.  You must complete this step to administer the server from a remote system using a web browser.
    
   If you are upgrading, you will be presented with a web browser login window.

Set Up (Mac OS X)

After creating an administrator user name and password,  you can connect to the Darwin Streaming Server from your web browser.

Enter the URL for your Darwin Streaming Server:
http://myserver.com:1220

Replace "myserver.com" with the name of your Darwin Streaming Server computer. 
1220 is the port number.

    
Installing Darwin Streaming Server (Linux, Solaris)

To install Darwin Streaming Server 5.5 software, follow these steps on the server computer:

Stop any Darwin Streaming Server related processes.

IMPORTANT: Installing Darwin Streaming Server will remove older versions of Darwin Streaming Server. 
If an existing configuration is found, then the /etc/streamingserver.xml configuration file will be copied to 
/etc/streamingserver.xml.bak. 

After the install completes, you may need to reset your configuration settings from your /etc/streamingserver.xml.bak file.
    
Expand the compressed (.gz) tar file and "cd" into one of the following directories, depending on the platform: 
    DarwinStreamingSrvr5.5-Linux 

Then type: 
    ./Install

During the install, the streamingadminserver.pl application will automatically launch. To avoid the need to manually relaunch streamingadminserver.pl following reboots, you may want to configure your server machine to launch it automatically at boot time.

Set Up (Linux)
During the install, you will be asked to create a user name and password for administering the server.  You must complete this step to administer the server from a remote system using a web browser.

After creating an administrator user name and password,  you can connect to the Darwin Streaming Server from your web browser.

Enter the URL for your Darwin Streaming Server:
    http://myserver.com:1220

Replace "myserver.com" with the name of your Darwin Streaming Server computer. 
    1220 is the port number.


Installing Darwin Streaming Server (Windows 2000/2003 Server)

The Streaming Admin requires ActivePerl 5.8 (or later) to be running on the server machine. You must install a Perl interpreter in order to use the web-based administration software. 


To install Darwin Streaming Server software, follow these steps on the server computer:

Stop any Darwin Streaming Server related processes.

When the Server package is unzipped, a folder with Darwin Streaming Server and associated files will be created. Inside this folder is an Install script, named "Install.bat". Double-click this file to install the server and its components on the server machine. The installer also starts up the Streaming Server Admin, so keep the command prompt window open.
Ê
The Install script will create the following directory:

c:\Program Files\Darwin Streaming Server\

Inside this directory you will find:

DarwinStreamingServer.exe - Server executable
PlaylistBroadcaster.exe - PlaylistBroadcaster executable
MP3Broadcaster.exe Ð MP3 Broadcaster executable
qtpasswd.exe - Command-line utility for generating password files for access control
StreamingLoadTool.exe - RTSP simulated client stress tool
streamingadminserver.pl - Admin Server that is used for administering the Streaming Server
streamingserver.xml- Default server configuration file
relayconfig.xml-Sample - Sample relay configuration file
QTSSModules\ - Folder containing QTSS API modules
Movies\ - Media folder
Playlists\ - Folder containing Playlist configuration
Logs\ - Folder containing access and error logs
AdminHtml\ - Folder containing the CGIs and the HTMl files required by the Admin Server
Documentation\ - Documentation folder

The Install script also installs Darwin Streaming Server as a service in the Service Manager. It is possible to start, stop, and check server status from the Service control panel.

The Install script will attempt to launch the Admin Server. Make sure that the Perl interpreter installed on your machine is in the system PATH.

The Admin Server can be launched from the command prompt by typing:

C:\> perlpath "C:\Program Files\Darwin Streaming Server\streamingadminserver.pl"

where perlpath is the path to the Perl interpreter on your machine.


    If you are installing for the first time,  you will be asked to create a user name and password for administering the server.  You must complete this step to administer the server from a remote system using a web browser.
    

Set Up (Windows 2000/2003 Server)

    After creating an administrator user name and password,  you can connect to the Darwin Streaming Server from your web browser.

   Enter the URL for your Darwin Streaming Server:
http://localhost:1220 on the same local system or
http://myserver.com:1220 from a remote system

Replace "myserver.com" with the name of your Darwin Streaming Server computer. 
1220 is the port number.
