# Note: 
# For each keyword, the first sentence in the comment 
# explains the keyword, and the usage: line explains
# how to use it. Anything not in angle brackets is a keyword
# and keywords are case-sensitive.
# The comment is followed by an example usage

# AuthName: The authentication realm that will be
# presented to the client (for Basic Authentication only)
# usage: AuthName <realm>
# where realm can be a single word or a quoted multi-word string
AuthName "Test"

# require user: The names next to this specify which user 
# is allowed to access the media in this folder.
#
# NOTE: The Seach node in OD is used for looking up users, the module will
#		query for users following the search path setup in Directory Access. 
#		The username should be the user's shortname (RecordName).
#		Example: jdoe, johndoe
#
# below are two special cases:
# require any-user         =>      implies any user is allowed without
#                                  requiring authentication
# require valid-user       =>      implies any user that is
#                                  authenticated is allowed access
# usage: require user <username1> <username2> ...
#require user johndoe
#require valid-user

# require group: The names of the groups that are allowed
# access to the media in this folder
#
# NOTE: The search node in OD is used for looking up groups, the module will
#		follow the search path defined in Directory Access. It should also
#		be noted that groups should have unique names across directories.
# usage: require group <groupname1> <groupname2> ...
#require group qtsstest wireless
